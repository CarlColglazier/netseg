Description: Network homophily is a pattern in which ties are more likely to
	exist between nodes similar to each other. It is frequently observed
	for various types of social relations. At the same time, segregation is often
	encountered in urban areas as a tendency of families to occupy neighborhoods
	inhabited by other families similar to them. This package implements
	most important numerical indexes to measure the extent of homophily/segregation
	in a network in which vertices are assigned to two or more groups. It
	is a computational companion to the paper by Bojanowski & Corten (2014) <doi:10.1016/j.socnet.2014.04.001>.

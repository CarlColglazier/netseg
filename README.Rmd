# `netseg`: Measures of Network Segregation and Homophily <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="20%" />

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is an R package implementing most important descriptive measures of homophily and segregation in social networks. See Bojanowski & Corten (2014) for a review.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of netseg from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("netseg")
```
-->

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mbojan/netseg")
```







## Example

To illustrate, consider the Classroom network below:

```{r Classroom, dev="svg"}
library(netseg)
library(igraph)

data("Classroom")

plot(
  Classroom,
  layout = graphlayouts::layout_with_stress,
  vertex.color = c("pink", "lightskyblue")[match(V(Classroom)$gender, c("Girl", "Boy"))],
  vertex.label = NA,
  edge.arrow.size = 0.5
)
legend(
  "bottomright",
  pch = 21,
  legend = c("Boy", "Girl"),
  pt.cex = 2,
  pt.bg = c("lightskyblue", "pink"),
  col = "black",
  bty = "n"
)
```

The extent of gender segregation in this network can be assessed using one of the indices provided in the package, for example odds ratio of within-group tie (`orwg()`)

```{r Classroom-orwg}
orwg(Classroom, "gender")
```

tells us that within-gender ties are `r orwg(Classroom, "gender")` times more likely than between-gender ties. Coleman's index (Coleman 1958) assesses the segregation on the group level:

```{r Classroom-coleman}
coleman(Classroom, "gender")
```

Qualitatively speaking it compares the proportion of same-group neighbors to the proportion of that group in the network as a whole. It is a number between 0 and 1. Value of 0 means these proportions are equal. Value of 1 means that all ties outgoing from a particular group are sent to the members of the same group.
